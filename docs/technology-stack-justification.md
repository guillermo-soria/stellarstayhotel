# Technology Stack Justification

## Programming Language
- **TypeScript**: Chosen for its strong typing, modern JavaScript features, and excellent support for large-scale, maintainable applications. TypeScript improves code reliability and developer productivity.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- **Node.js**: Runtime for executing JavaScript/TypeScript server-side code.
- **Express (or similar)**: For REST API routing and middleware (implied by structure).
- **Prisma ORM**: For type-safe database access and migrations.
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **ESLint, Prettier**: For code quality and formatting.

## Databases and Caching Solutions
- **SQLite (dev.db via Prisma)**: Lightweight, file-based database for development and testing. Can be swapped for PostgreSQL/MySQL in production.
- **Redis**: In-memory cache for performance optimization and reducing database load.

## Infrastructure Components
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestration of app, database, cache, and optional AI services.
- **Healthchecks**: For service reliability and monitoring.
- **Optional Ollama**: For AI integration (bonus, not required for core functionality).

## Justification
- The stack is modern, widely adopted, and supports rapid development, scalability, and maintainability.
- TypeScript and Node.js are ideal for full-stack and API-driven applications.
- Prisma and Redis provide robust data management and performance.
- Docker ensures reproducible environments and easy onboarding.
